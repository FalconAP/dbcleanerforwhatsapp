	Modified : 
		- [app/src/main/java/...ScheduleService.kt] to allow the service to auto clean files if enabled. fim
	Added :
		- [fastlane/metadata/android/changelogs/2.txt]
		- New stable release: v1.0

	Notes : 
	- On some devices such as Xiaomi phones the Battery Saver prevents the app from scheduling tasks in the background while the device is idle/sleeping. The user has to whitelist the app for the auto-clean to work.

	- The app saves a log each time it auto cleans the backup files. 
	- The log file is saved to >> [sdcard/Android/data/com.tserumula.dbcleanerforwhatsapp/files/service_log.txt]
