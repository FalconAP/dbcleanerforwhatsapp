# DbCleanerforWhatsapp

Android App to help remove Whatsapp database files from external storage. 

The backup files kept by Whatsapp can sometimes end up taking too much storage space on a phone and this app is meant to help with this problem by removing the backup files that are redundant/ not needed. 

The user can clear the files manually or schedule the app to automatically remove the redundant files daily/weekly.
